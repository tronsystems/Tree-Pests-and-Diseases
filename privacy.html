	<h3>&nbsp;<a name="DPA"></a>The Data Protection Act</h3>
	<p>The Forestry Commission is a data controller under the Data Protection Act. 
	Under the Act, we have a legal duty to protect any information we collect from 
	you. We safeguard your data, and keep strict security standards to prevent 
	any unauthorised access to it. We do not pass on your details to any 
	third party or other government department (except to process on our behalf) 
	unless you give us permission to do so.</p>

	<h3><a name="Cookies"></a>Cookies</h3>
	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	<p>When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. 
	Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing 
	small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile 
	phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to 
	identify you personally.</p>
	<p>These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, 
	for example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task</li>
		<li>recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested</li>
		<li>measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You can manage these small files yourself and learn more about them through &nbsp;"<a rel="external" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/managingcookies" target="_blank">Internet browser cookies - what they are and how to manage them</a>"</p>
