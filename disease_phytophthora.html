		<p>
		<em>Phytophthora ramorum</em> causes a highly damaging tree disease known as <em>Sudden Oak Death</em>.  
		Lethal infection of trees by P. ramorum is rare, but the symptoms can be very similar to those 
		caused by other tree diseases.  You&#39;ll find information below on how to spot signs of the disease.
		</p>
		<p>
		Around 40 plant species have been found to be susceptible to infection. Beech and Red Oak are
		the most susceptible tree species so far in Europe.  Infected holm oak and sweet chestnut 
		have also been reported, but only the foliage is affected. With some ornamental species, 
		particularly Rhododendron and Pieris, leaves and shoots are affected, whereas with 
		Viburnum the stem bases are affected.
		</p>
		<p>	
		<em>Trunk</em>: Infection is these usually characterised by the presence of dark red to 
		black sap oozing from the trunk: 'bleeding cankers' or 'tarry spots'.
		This is often on the lower portion of the trunk but may also occur several metres up the stem. 
		When the outer bark is removed from the bleeding canker, mottled areas of necrotic, dead and 
		discoloured inner-bark tissue can be seen. Black 'zone lines' are often present within 
		and around the edges of the necrotic region.

		</p>
		<p>	
		<em>Foliage</em>: The necrosis caused by bleeding cankers may girdle the tree and result in rapid death. As a result, 
		foliage may change colour rapidly and uniformly throughout the crown, with the withered leaves 
		remaining on branches after death. Young foliage or epicormic shoots are the most commonly
		affected.
